# Step 01 - Planning the PC Build

## Purpose of the Build
This PC is designed for:
- Music production (recording, mixing, mastering)
- Old games
- General productivity
- Future-proof upgrades

Low noise levels and system stability are priority.

## Budget
Target budget: ~500 EUR
The budget focuses on long-term reliability rather than RGB or visual design.

## Hardware Consideration
- CPU performance for audio workloads
- Quiet cooling solution
- Sufficient RAM for large projects
- Expandable Storage options

## Compatibility Checks
- CPU socket matches motherboard
- Case supports full-length GPU
- PSU wattage sufficient for future upgrades
- RAM compatibility verified via motherboard QVL

## Risk Assessment
Potential risks identified:
- BIOS version may require update
- GPU clearance in case
- Cooling airflow configuration

## Outcome 
All Components were verified for compatibility before purchase.
